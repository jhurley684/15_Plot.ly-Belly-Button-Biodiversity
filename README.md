### Plot.ly15-Belly-Button-Biodiversity
How well do you wash your belly button and does it make any difference?  The data is in and you can find out whether washing makes a difference and what kind of bacteria might be affected most just by working through our Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard.  

By selecting a specific sample Test Subject Id in the dropdown selector, the Demographic area shows the demographic details about each sample submitted. Additionally the top 10 Bacteria cultures are displayed in the bar chart.  How much the subject washed is displayed in the guage display.  Finally, the amount & extent of each sample is shown in a bubble chart.  

Then again, you might not be into navel-gazing and if that's the case, please enjoy the code featuring our friends plotly and d3.

Some starter code setting up data acquisition and initial bar chart set-up was taken from instructor Dom LaBella's lecture.
